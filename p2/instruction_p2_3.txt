Dynamic Allocation

Use a command line argument for the total number of students (n>2).
In the standard input, get n(the number you input) names in a single line when the
instruction “enter names:” is given. Use 2D dynamic allocation to store all names
in one variable.
Print your result in standard output.

ex)
    p2_3 4
    enter 4 names:
    Bravo Charlie Delta Echo
    the names you entered:
    Bravo
    Charlie
    Delta
    Echo

program name : p2_3.c
data structure : array of pointers.
input : n names
output : n names
conditions:
1. the number of students should be more than two.
2. use dynamic allocation to store names (malloc())
3. the length of the user name should be up to 30 characters.
4. no black space is allowed in the name.
